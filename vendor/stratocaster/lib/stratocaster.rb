# Stratocaster is a system for storing and retrieving Messages in Feeds.
# A Feed is a secondary index of Messages.  Complex SQL queries are
# replaced in favor of multiple/overlapping Feeds to filter Messages.
# Abstract adapters are used to persist the data.

  # Public: Processes a received Message.  Since Stratocaster only stores the
  # ID (usually, depends on the adapter), assume that the message is already
  # stored in some other ActiveModel-compatible store (ActiveRecord, ToyStore,
  # etc).

  # message - A Hash:
  #           id - The String Message ID.
  #           created_at - The Time the Message was created.
  #           actor - A Hash with at least an `id` property to identify the
  #                   user that created the message.
  #           payload - A Hash holding custom values for the Message.
  #
  # Returns an Array of  Feeds that this message was delivered to.

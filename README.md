# Gravastar

I don't even know what this is going to be, yet.  Right now, it's just a
Redis/Riak testbed.  Probably not useful for anyone.

## Setup

* Setup Redis and Riak Search
* `ruby app.rb` to start an IRB console
* `GRAVASTAR_ENV=irb ruby app.rb` to start a Sinatra server.

## Tests

No tests.  *shrug*
